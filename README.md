# Shallow-Q-Network-for-TicTacToe

This report outlines my attempt at implementing a Shallow Q-Network (SQN) to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It includes a briefoverview of the problem statement, the idea behind approaching the problem with a SQN, a theoretical explanation of the network and Q-Learning algorithm, the various attempts/methods of implementation and training and finally a discussionon the findings.
